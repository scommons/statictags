# HTML Specs

These CSVs are extracted from [the elements section of the w3 website](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/index.html#elements-1) and [the attributes section of the w3 website](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/index.html#attributes-1).

When specs are updated, you need to update the CSVs here and re-generate the statictags code.
